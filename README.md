# BikeSharing

## Overview
### Purpose

This project is about analyzing the bike-share business in New York City with a possible prospect of having a similar program in Des Moines, Illinois. In this analysis, the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week are explored for August 2019. To convince investors and to portray easy-to-understand visuals, this analysis will be shown via Tableau.
